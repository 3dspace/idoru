## This repository is for my ever-evolving side project at the corner of Conversational A.I. and User Experience Design.

Inspired by ELIZA, the original chatter-bot, and Idoru, a character from William Gibson's Bridge Trilogy, I've tinkered over the years with making systems that not only communicate with end users, but seek to charm users through non-verbal and contextual behaviours that constitute "giving good user experience", and more to the point, "charm". ELIZA long ago surprised researchers by exposing a human willingness to be persuaded by a simple algorithm. Idoru developed her artificial charm and used it to escape from the dank confines of 3rd-party hardware.

Since graduating from York University's Machine Learning Cerificate Program, I have begun tinkering again with charming chatbots, this time using Natural Language Processing, Language Models, deep neural networks using keras and TensorFlow, and harnessing the power of cloud-based GPUs to train models that would have been impossible a few years ago.

## When this repository was created for JavaScript code in 2016, this was the description:

[ Interact with the 2016 model ](https://petegray.ca/idoru/)

A JavaScript library for creating artificially intelligent beings in virtual worlds.

Will work with three.js and X3DOM, at least.

An AI with an avatar for virtual worlds on the open web.
